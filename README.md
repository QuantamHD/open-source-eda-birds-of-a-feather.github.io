This Birds-of-a-Feather meeting is the third in a series that began with the DAC 2018 and 2019 Open-Source Academic EDA Software Birds-of-a-Feather meetings, and that has a number of participants who also attend the WOSET workshop.  This year, the topic of benchmarking is being added to the discussion.  This session serves as an informal meeting point for anyone who would like to hear or share ideas or latest news on (1) the ecosystem of open-source EDA tools, and/or (2) the use of relevant and principled benchmarking methodologies to clarify and advance the leading edge of EDA research. Goals for the community, along with current landscape, key updates, and potential next steps / actions for the worldwide academic/CAD community are all topics for discussion. Potential contributors, developers, advisors, users â€¦ Everyone is WELCOME !!! (Please send email to abk@eng.ucsd.edu with any questions.)
